Diego's Gallery

Recently I've been developing a platform to manage my cat's photos and keep my flag.txt safe. Please check out my beta
To avoid security loop holes such as SQL injections I developed my own scheme.
A short description is available here

Every line in my DB look's like this:

> START|||username|||password|||role|||END

So for example:

> START|||diego|||catnip|||admin|||END
> START|||joe|||1234567|||user|||END
